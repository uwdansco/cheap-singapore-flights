This document outlines the security measures, policies, and procedures for the Cheap Atlanta Flights platform.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter

### Authorization

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **User Role**: Access to own destinations, alerts, and preferences
- **Admin Role**: Full access to all data and admin dashboard

#### Row-Level Security (RLS)
All database tables have RLS policies:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins can access all data
- Public tables (destinations, price_history) readable by all
- Sensitive operations require authentication

### API Security

#### Rate Limiting
Implemented at multiple levels:

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Auth (login/signup) | 5 requests | 1 minute |
| Email verification | 5 requests | 1 hour |
| API endpoints | 60 requests | 1 minute |
| Price checks | 100 requests | 1 hour |

#### Input Validation
All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas:
- Email addresses
- Passwords
- Names (no special characters except hyphens and apostrophes)
- Price thresholds (positive numbers, max $10,000)
- UUIDs

#### SQL Injection Prevention
- All queries use parameterized statements
- No string concatenation in SQL queries
- Supabase client library handles escaping

#### XSS Prevention
- All user input is sanitized before display
- React's automatic escaping
- No dangerouslySetInnerHTML with user content
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

#### CSRF Protection
- CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
- Tokens stored in session storage
- Tokens validated on server-side
- SameSite cookie attribute set

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **In Transit**: HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables
   - Add .env to .gitignore
   - Use Supabase secrets for sensitive data

2. **Always validate input**
   - Use Zod schemas
   - Sanitize before display
   - Validate on both client and server

3. **Use parameterized queries**
   - Never concatenate SQL strings
   - Use Supabase client library methods

4. **Implement proper error handling**
   - Don't expose stack traces in production
   - Log errors securely
   - Show user-friendly error messages

5. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

6. **Review RLS policies**
   - Test with different user roles
   - Use `auth.uid()` for user-specific access
   - Use `is_admin()` function for admin checks

### For Admins

1. **Use strong passwords**
   - Follow password requirements
   - Use password manager
   - Enable 2FA (when available)

2. **Monitor audit logs**
   - Review weekly
   - Investigate suspicious activity
   - Check for unauthorized access

3. **Review user accounts**
   - Remove inactive accounts
   - Verify admin access is needed
   - Check for suspicious signups

4. **Monitor email deliverability**
   - Check bounce rates
   - Review spam complaints
   - Maintain sender reputation

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Security Incident Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0)
- Data breach
- Admin account compromise
- SQL injection vulnerability
- System-wide outage

**Response Time**: Immediate (< 1 hour)

#### High (P1)
- User account compromise
- Unauthorized access attempt
- XSS vulnerability
- Service degradation

**Response Time**: 4 hours

#### Medium (P2)
- Suspicious login activity
- Rate limit bypass
- Minor vulnerability

**Response Time**: 24 hours

#### Low (P3)
- Security policy violation
- Outdated dependency
- Non-critical bug

**Response Time**: 7 days

### Incident Response Procedure

1. **Detect**: Monitor logs, error tracking, user reports
2. **Assess**: Determine severity and scope
3. **Contain**: Limit damage (disable accounts, block IPs)
4. **Investigate**: Root cause analysis
5. **Remediate**: Fix vulnerability
6. **Recover**: Restore normal operations
7. **Document**: Update incident log
8. **Review**: Post-mortem and improvements
